						<h2>Application of Multivariate Regression in Python-Based Lipidomics Principal Component Analysis </h2>
					</header>
					<p>The goal of identifying the differential expression <i>in silico</i> often
						becomes a proverbial "fishing expedition". To inject precision into the label-free mass spectrometric analysis of lipids, the following pipeline was developed. <br />
						First, .raw files from the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) were converted into mzML files. A first pass of these files was performed with SIMLipid, a proprietary software that relies upon the LipidMAPS database. Files were then converted to .csv for data cleaning and batch analysis. The homogeneous distribution of matrix-cluster signals were identified for each of the matrices employed, followed by the identification of homogeneous distribution of endogenous molecular signals in positive and negative ion mode. The inclusion of both external (ESTD) and internal (ISTD) standards allows for confirmation of lipid abundance using normalization algorithms. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed.</p>
						<pre>
						<code>
# Install and load the necessary packages
install.packages("lipidr")
library(lipidr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Load and preprocess the data
data <- read.csv("lipidomics_data.csv", header = TRUE) # replace "lipidomics_data.csv" with the name of your data file
data_filtered <- filter_lipids(data, min_intensity = 1000, max_missing = 0.5) # filter out low-intensity lipids and lipids with >50% missing values
data_normalized <- normalize_lipids(data_filtered, method = "TIC") # normalize the data using Total Ion Current (TIC)

# Exploratory data analysis
summary(data_normalized) # summarize the normalized data
hist(data_normalized[,1]) # plot a histogram of the normalized intensities for the first lipid
boxplot(data_normalized) # plot boxplots of the normalized intensities for all lipids

# Multivariate analysis
pca <- prcomp(data_normalized, scale. = TRUE) # perform PCA on the normalized data
biplot(pca, col = "black", cex = 0.8) # plot a biplot of the PCA results

# Data visualization
ggplot(data_normalized, aes(x = LipidClass, y = Intensity, fill = SampleType)) + geom_boxplot() # plot a boxplot of the normalized intensities by lipid class and sample type
ggplot(data_normalized, aes(x = LipidClass, y = Intensity, color = SampleType)) + geom_jitter() # plot a jitter plot of the normalized intensities by lipid class and sample type
ggplot(data_normalized, aes(x = LipidClass, y = Intensity, fill = SampleType)) + geom_violin() # plot a violin plot of the normalized intensities by lipid class and sample type

						<p>Briefly, following attribution of signals to LipidMAPS identities, means and deviations thereof were calculated with relative abundance values. Covariant matrices were constructed, with several iterations of eigenvector calculations and values of covariance for each. Finally, data z-scores were projected onto new basis. Resulting graph shown.
